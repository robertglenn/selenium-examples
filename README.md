# Automated Behavior Testing
Automated behavior tests replaces the vast majority of manual User Acceptance Testing for the web, by simulating user interactions with a web page.
* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) - "automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style" (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)))
* [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) - "a portable software-testing framework for web applications" (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)))
* Check out the [Webdriver Javascript API](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html)

# Purpose of this repo
I personally have trouble finding useful examples (beyond 'hello world' or snippets) of behavior tests.

I hope to provide real-world examples of behavior tests for popular websites to better showcase how to write behavior tests.
