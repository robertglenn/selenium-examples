# Automated Behavior Testing
Automated behavior testing replaces the vast majority of manual user acceptance testing (UAT) for the web, by simulating a user's interactions with a web page.

##### Useful Links
* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) - "automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style" (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)))
* [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) - "a portable software-testing framework for web applications" (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)))

# Purpose of this repo
I personally have trouble finding useful examples (beyond 'hello world' or snippets) of behavior tests.

There are definitedly some great resources out there that build off of selenium-webdriver, but many of them include other third-party libraries (which, at best, obscures behavior).

I hope to provide real-world examples of behavior tests for popular websites to better showcase how to write behavior tests with as few "magic" libraries as possible.

# Shout outs
* I'm using [Matt-B/cucumber-js-selenium-webdriver-example](https://github.com/Matt-B/cucumber-js-selenium-webdriver-example) heavily as an example, at least to get off the ground.
